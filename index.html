        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/supporting.png" alt="supporting image" />
          <figcaption>
            Average NYPD complaints per officer steadily declined from 1985 to
            2019
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            [2] Data Transformations: The dataset was grouped by the year in
            which each complaint was received, and the total number of unique
            complaints (complaint_id) were calculated for each year. The number
            of distinct officers (unique_mos_id) involved in complaints during
            the same period was then determined. Dividing the total number of
            complaints by the number of officers each year produced the average
            number complaints per officer, providing a normalized measure that
            accounts for fluctuations in the size of the police force over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            [2] Downward Trend Line: A linear trend line was added to highlight
            the overall decline in average complaints per officer over time,
            drawing attention to the long-term pattern rather than year-to-year
            fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            [-1] Truncated Y-Axis: The y-axis begins at 0.8 instead of 0 to
            visually accentuate the decrease in complaint rates. This design
            choice makes the downard trend appear steeper, enhancing the visual
            impression of improvement over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            [2] Dropped Values: Data from 2020 was omitted due to incomplete
            records, as complaints were collected only during the early months
            of that year. Including this partial data would have created a
            misleading spike in the average complaints per officer. Removing it
            ensures the visualization maintains a consistent comparison across
            years.
          </li>
          <li>
            [2] Annotations: Text labels were added to mark the peak and lowest
            points of the trend. These annotations guide viewers toward the most
            significant moments in the data, reinforcing the main proposition
            that the NYPD is held accountable for civilian complaints.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/opposing.png" alt="opposing image" />
          <figcaption>
            Complaints involving use of force are rarely substantiated,
            indicating persistent gaps in officer accountability
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            [2] Dropped 2020 Values: The year 2020 was intentionally excluded
            from the visualization because complaint data from that year is
            incomplete, likely as a result of the ongoing reporting period.
            Including data from that year would have introduced inaccuracies and
            falsely suggest a sharp decline in both complaints and
            substantiation rate. By removing this partial data, the
            visualization maintains a more consistent and fair representation of
            trends over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            [-2] Framing bias through the title and interpretation: The
            visualization's title, "Officers Accused of Using Force Rarely Face
            Consequences," frames the data and conclusion in a negative light.
            It looks like there is a direct casual relationship between the
            number of force-related complaints and a low substantiation rate.
            While persuasive, this framing overlooks that the total number of
            substantiated comlpaints has increased over time. Moreover, around
            1997, there were roughly 30 complaints * 0.4 substantiation rate =
            12 substantiated complaints, whereas by 2015, approximately 550
            complaints * 0.7 substation rate = 385 substantiated complaints. By
            focusing only on the ratio rather than the total substantiated
            outcomes, the visualization makes it seem as though accountability
            has declined. However, in reality, the number of officers facing
            consequences has increased, reavealing a deceptive framing that
            supports the opposing argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            [-1] Selective Framing: The visualization focuses on complaints
            categorized under "fado_type" == force, ignoring all other possible
            categories. This selective inclusino amplifies the perception that
            the NYPD is not held accountable, as it highlightsa specific area of
            concern. By filtering the data in this way, the visualization limits
            the viewer's understanding of overll accountability trends across
            the department. If other complaint types were included, the
            substantiation rate may appear more balanced, potentially altering
            the narrative.
          </li>
          <li>
            [-2] Dual-axis Manipulation and Misleading Color Coding: The
            visualization uses two y-axes (Red for total complaints, blue for
            substantiation rate) to suggest a relationship between metrics that
            are not directly comparable. The shared area between the two lines
            creates the illusion of a growing "gap" between complaints and
            accountability, as if the difference were a meaningul measure.
            However, the two variables are plotted on unrelated scales, so the
            shaded region does not represent any real quantity. This design
            choice misleads viewers into believing that accountability has
            declined over time, when the visual difference is merely a result of
            axes manipulation.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This project examines whether the NYPD is held adequately accountable for 
          civilian complaints. The supporting visualization indicate the
          NYPD officer behavior has moved in a positive direction, reflecting a genuine
          process in NYPD's accountability. In contrast, the opposing visualization 
          suggests that while the total number of use-of-force complaints (red line) 
          surged after 2002, the substantiation rate for these complaints (blue line) 
          did not increase along with it. In fact, the rate is far lower than its peak 
          in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This gap highlights the decreasing 
          accountability of the police force. Both viewpoints don't have a clear right or 
          wrong answer, as they each present valid interpretations of the data. It depends 
          on how the viewer chooses to frame the issue of police accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          One surprising aspect of this project was how different data
          transformations could completely change how trends appeared. For
          instance, calculating ratios, such as the substantiation rate of force
          complaints, made long-term patterns much clearer and highlighted how
          the issue of excessive force has persisted over time. We also
          discovered that visual form plays a major role in persuasion:
          combining a line chart with a regression line often produced the most
          convincing narrative. By emphasizing the overall downward or upward
          trend, these visuals helped audiences focus on the broader pattern
          rather than minor year-to-year fluctuations. 
          At the same time, creating persuasive yet ethical visualizations proved to be a
          challenging balance. While it was relatively easy to compute yearly
          averages using groupby functions and generate line plots, finding data
          that convincingly supported either side of our proposition required
          extensive exploration. In many cases, the data did not align with our
          initial expectations causing many road bumps, forcing us to rethink
          how to best represent it. The most difficult aspect was maintaining
          analytical depth and clarity without oversimplifying complex patterns
          or creating misleading narratives through poor design choices. Subtle
          visual techniques, such as axis scaling or selective filtering, could
          make trends appear more dramatic than they truly were, reminding us
          how easily data can be manipulated to fit a desired story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this process, we came to define ethical analysis and
          visualization as the effort to present data truthfully, without
          ignoring unfavorable information or reinforcing bias. Ethical
          visualization means helping audiences correctly interpret the data's
          meaning without being influenced by misleading design choices.
          Techniques like truncating axes, using emotionally charged titles, or
          selectively filtering data can all skew perception, so maintaining
          transparency about these decisions is essential to establish trust. An
          ethical visualization should reveal the full context behind the data,
          acknowledging its limitations and potential sources of bias.
