        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/supporting.png" alt="supporting image" />
          <figcaption>
            Average NYPD complaints per officer steadily declined from 1985 to
            2019
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            [2] Data Transformations: The dataset was grouped by the year in
            which each complaint was received, and the total number of unique
            complaints (complaint_id) were calculated for each year. The number
            of distinct officers (unique_mos_id) involved in complaints during
            the same period was then determined. Dividing the total number of
            complaints by the number of officers each year produced the average
            number complaints per officer, providing a normalized measure that
            accounts for fluctuations in the size of the police force over time
          </li>
          <li>
            [2] Downward Trend Line: A linear trend line was added to highlight
            the overall decline in average complaints per officer over time,
            drawing attention to the long-term pattern rather than year-to-year
            fluctuations
          </li>
          <li>
            [-1] Truncated Y-Axis: The y-axis begins at 0.8 instead of 0 to
            visually accentuate the decrease in complaint rates. This design
            choice makes the downward trend appear steeper, enhancing the visual
            impression of improvement over time
          </li>
          <li>
            [1.5] Dropped Values: Data from 2020 was omitted due to incomplete
            records, as complaints were collected only during the early months
            of that year. Including this partial data would have created a
            misleading spike in the average complaints per officer. Removing it
            ensures the visualization maintains a consistent comparison across
            years
          </li>
          <li>
            [2] Annotations: Text labels were added to mark the peak and lowest
            points of the trend. These annotations guide viewers toward the most
            significant moments in the data, reinforcing the main proposition
            that the NYPD is held accountable for civilian complaints
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/opposing.png" alt="opposing image" />
          <figcaption>
            Complaints involving use of force are rarely substantiated,
            indicating persistent gaps in officer accountability
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            [-0.5] Truncated Y-Axis: The y-axis begins at 0.5 rather than 0 to
            exaggerate the perceived decline in substantation rates over time.
            This framing choice visually amplifies small variations, making the
            downward trend appear steeper and more pronounced than it actually
            is.
          </li>
          <li>
            [-2] Title Framing: The title employs emotionally charged language
            to establish a critical tone. By emphasizing that officers "rarely
            face consequences," the visualization primes viewers to interpret
            the data as evidence of systemic accountability issues within the
            NYPD. However, this framing hides contextual information, such as
            the rising number of total substantiated cases in recent years,
            which would provide a more balanced perspective
          </li>
          <li>
            [-1] Selective Filtering: The visualization focuses exclusively on
            complaints involving use of force, excluding other categories. This
            selective focus narrows the audience's attention to one of the most
            severe complaint types, heightening the emotional and ethical weight
            of the visualization. While this strengthens hte persuasive
            narrative, it presents an invcomplete picture of overall complaint
            outcomes across the departments
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          One surprising aspect of this project was how different data
          transformations could completely change how trends appeared. For
          instance, calculating ratios, such as the substantiation rate of force
          complaints, made long-term patterns much clearer and highlighted how
          the issue of excessive force has persisted over time. We also
          discovered that visual form plays a major role in persuasion:
          combining a line chart with a regression line often produced the most
          convincing narrative. By emphasizing the overall downward or upward
          trend, these visuals helped audiences focus on the broader pattern
          rather than minor year-to-year fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating persuasive yet ethical visualizations proved to be a
          challenging balance. While it was relatively easy to compute yearly
          averages using groupby functions and generate line plots, finding data
          that convincingly supported either side of our proposition required
          extensive exploration. In many cases, the data did not align with our
          initial expectations causing many road bumps, forcing us to rethink
          how to best represent it. The most difficult aspect was maintaining
          analytical depth and clarity without oversimplifying complex patterns
          or creating misleading narratives through poor design choices. Subtle
          visual techniques, such as axis scaling or selective filtering, could
          make trends appear more dramatic than they truly were, reminding us
          how easily data can be manipulated to fit a desired story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this process, we came to define ethical analysis and
          visualization as the effort to present data truthfully, without
          ignoring unfavorable information or reinforcing bias. Ethical
          visualization means helping audiences correctly interpret the data's
          meaning without being influenced by misleading design choices.
          Techniques like truncating axes, using emotionally charged titles, or
          selectively filtering data can all skew perception, so maintaining
          transparency about these decisions is essential to establish trust. An
          ethical visualization should reveal the full context behind the data,
          acknowledging its limitations and potential sources of bias.
